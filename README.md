# trading_strategies_SPTL_etf
This repository contains three trading strategies: momentum, mean reversion, and an XGBoost model with signals, specifically designed for the SPDR Portfolio Long Term Treasury ETF. Each strategy operates with a leverage factor of 10, which can be adjusted as needed, and incorporates the risk-free rate into the profit and loss calculations. However, it does not account for transaction costs and spreads.

The momentum strategy capitalizes on the continuation of existing trends, aiming to profit from the persistence of price movements in the ETF.

Conversely, the mean reversion strategy seeks to exploit the tendency of prices to revert to their historical averages, identifying opportunities to buy low and sell high within the ETF's price fluctuations.

The XGBoost model, coupled with signals, employs a machine learning approach to analyze various factors and generate actionable signals for trading the ETF, potentially enhancing decision-making processes with advanced predictive analytics.

These strategies collectively offer diverse approaches to trading the SPDR Portfolio Long Term Treasury ETF, catering to different trading styles and objectives. Investors can explore and implement these strategies based on their preferences, risk appetite, and market outlook. Adjustments to leverage and consideration of transaction costs and spreads may be necessary depending on individual trading circumstances.
